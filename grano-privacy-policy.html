  <h1>Privacy Policy</h1>

  <p><strong>Grano Finance Tracker</strong> (“Grano”, “we”, “our”, or “us”) respects your privacy. This Privacy Policy explains how the app handles information when you use Grano.</p>

  <h2>1. Data We Handle</h2>
  <p><strong>Personal data you provide</strong> (e.g., email for account creation) is used to authenticate you via providers like Apple/Firebase. We do not sell your data.</p>
  <p><strong>Financial records you enter</strong> (expenses, categories, notes) are stored locally on your device and sync to cloud backends.</p>
  <p><strong>Diagnostic data</strong> (crash/usage logs) may be collected to improve app stability and performance.</p>

  <h2>2. Payments & Subscriptions</h2>
  <p>Purchases and subscriptions are processed by Apple via <em>In‑App Purchase</em>. We do not receive or store your full payment details. Subscription status may be validated via RevenueCat solely to manage entitlements (e.g., “Pro” access).</p>

  <h2>3. How We Use Data</h2>
  <ul>
    <li>Provide and improve app features (e.g., budgeting, CSV import, analytics).</li>
    <li>Authenticate users and restore purchases.</li>
    <li>Detect, prevent, and address technical issues and abuse.</li>
  </ul>

  <h2>4. Sharing</h2>
  <p>We do not sell your personal data. We may share minimal data with service providers (e.g., authentication, analytics, purchase validation) strictly to operate the app and only as necessary.</p>

  <h2>5. Data Retention</h2>
  <p>We retain data as long as needed to provide the service. You can delete data at any time, either through account settings or by contacting us.</p>

  <h2>6. Security</h2>
  <p>We use reasonable safeguards to protect data. No method of transmission or storage is 100% secure.</p>

  <h2>7. International Transfers</h2>
  <p>Depending on your location and the location of our providers, your data may be processed in other countries with different data protection laws.</p>

  <h2>8. Changes to This Policy</h2>
  <p>We may update this policy. We may provide in‑app notice of material changes.</p>

  <h2>9. Contact</h2>
